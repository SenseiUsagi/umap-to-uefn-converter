# About

This is the source code for the [UMAP to UEFN converter](https://senseiusagi.github.io/umap-to-uefn-converter/) that I have created. With it you can convert .json versions of .umap files into a format that can be copy-pasted into UEFN. To get .json versions of .umap files use FModel.

# DISCLAIMER

When converting .umaps like this the probability of them validating in UEFN is extremly low because it uses assets from the game itself, instead of the ones available in UEFN.

# Dev Corner

This website was writting in mostly TypeScript, React, as well as React-Router for the routing.
